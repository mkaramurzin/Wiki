This project was written with the Django framework and requires a local server to function.

Make sure you have python installed, then use the terminal command "pip3 install Django" to install django.

Open a terminal window, change directory to the project folder, and enter this command:     python manage.py runserver

Now you can navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8000/ in an internet browser and see my project.
